# Complex
Complex-Thought is a simple application that lets you quickly dump everything you have in your mind to one place. Your brain is used for thinking, not for memory, so Complex-Thought can keep your mind clear and think clearly.

Putting Complex-Thought around, you can easily write down a note for later viewing, or use it like a diary to express all your inner thoughts. It is also a good companion for those who are too active to sleep.

Complex-Thought can also help you keep track of your inspiration every day, and record your inspiration anytime, anywhere to make you more efficient.

Complex-Thought can also record your bad thoughts. We have the function of expiring to delete ideas. We only need to uninstall your bad ideas into Complex-Thought, let bad ideas be deleted over time, and every day is new.
